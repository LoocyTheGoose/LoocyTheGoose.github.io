                <h2>The Year is 1999...</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the end of '98 and through the beginning of '99, news has spread of a viral contagion making people irritable
                    and aggressive. The West of the United States has seen large amounts of devastation across state borders. The East is
                    now experiencing something similar...<br /><br />

                    As more and more people find themselves falling ill, more and more destruction plagues the land. The county of Hairburg,
                    somewhere on the coast of Maryland is one of the first of the Eastern lands to fall victim to near total collapse. With
                    government facilities running out of fumes, entire cities find themselves devastated. In a last ditch effort, the PTA,
                    a secretive government agency is activated. As panic set in, skilled individuals who were formerly part of the general
                    public turn from their duties of protecting those they love, moving out of their previously safe establishments and
                    leaving friends and family behind. Gathering themselves, they founded the structure of the Goreville Quarantine zone
                    and began leading civilians to one of the few remaining safe places within it.<br /><br />

                    While this has worked, is it true safety? Or is this indicative of something more foreboding...
