                <h2>The year of 1969...</h2>
                <p>
                    During 1969, the world found itself in a very <i>interesting</i> place. With the Cold War sparking a space race, America
                    found itself landing on the moon. It was an extraordinary time for America, the first successful moon landing bringing
                    samples and glory back to Earth with much fanfare.<br /><br />

                    Among conspiracy theorists however, a group of people started prancing the country in protest, seemingly disturbed by
                    what was considered to be the dawn of the end of times. These people were brushed off by the general public and eventually
                    forgotten by the American populace. With America celebrating such a success, people started looking forward to the turn of
                    the millenia, expecting many a technological advancement from such a successful mission.

                <h2>The Year is 1999...</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the end of '98 and through the beginning of '99, news has spread of a viral contagion making people irritable
                    and aggressive. The West of the United States has seen large amounts of devastation across state borders. The East is
                    now experiencing something similar...<br /><br />

                    As more and more people find themselves falling ill, more and more destruction plagues the land. The county of Hairburg,
                    somewhere on the coast of Maryland is one of the first of the Eastern lands to fall victim to near total collapse. With
                    government facilities running out of fumes, entire cities find themselves devastated. In a last ditch effort, the PTA,
                    a secretive government agency is activated. As panic set in, skilled individuals who were formerly part of the general
                    public turn from their duties of protecting those they love, moving out of their previously safe establishments and
                    leaving friends and family behind. Gathering themselves, they founded the structure of the Goreville Quarantine zone
                    and began leading civilians to one of the few remaining safe places within it.<br /><br />

                    While this has worked, is it true safety? Or is this indicative of something more foreboding...

                <h2>Known Information...</h2>
                <p>
                    Experiencing the turmoil of the outbreak, the living - the most affected - have seen countless horrors before their eyes.
                    Those who were once loved now turned to violence and hunger, their bodies appearing to rapidly decay without seeming to die.
                    Some survivors appear to have a form of resistance to the virus, dubbed "X-39". Where most who are infected present with
                    necrotic decay soon after infection, a rare genetic resistance in these survivors seems to push the virus back, staving
                    those who would otherwise die, off, from the horrific death and subsequent reanimation.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h2>Two Types of Resistance</h2><br />
                <h3>Type 1 Immunity</h3>
                <p>
                    Those who happen to be type 1 immune are capable of pushing back the virus after a rigorous fever. While they are still
                    susceptible to the airborne strain of the virus, it will only make them incredibly ill after a period of exposure.<br />
                    Those with type 1 immunity must keep their faces covered with a particulate filter in order to prevent too much exposure.
                    If infected, these individuals will experience a fever capable of killing them if not treated properly. During this fever,
                    they may experience an allure to the virus, which is often the killer of infected immune persons. The sense of a presence
                    beyond them seems to draw them toward other infected. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Type 2 Immunity</h3>
                <p>
                    Those with Type 2 immunity are resistant to the airborne strain, only finding threat from the saliva of the infected.
                    Much like Type 1 immunity, if infected, these individuals will come down with a major fever capable of killing them,
                    experiencing much of the same symptoms as those with Type 1 immunity. They will find themselves wanting to walk into
                    hordes, feeling as if the only place they will find home is in the infection.<br />
                    While Type 2 immunity prevents susceptibility to the airborne strain, those with this immunity must still take caution
                    not to come into contact with the saliva of the infected.
